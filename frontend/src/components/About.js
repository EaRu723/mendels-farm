        ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andrea. I'm fascinated by the intersection of biology and technology so I studied Biomedical Engineering. Somewhere along the way, I realized that our lives have become needlessly complicated.
        <br />
        <br />
        My journey started with acne. After years of expensive creams, pills, and endless doctor visits, the solution wasn't in a bottle - it was on a farm. Switching to clean, whole foods did what thousands of dollars in treatments couldn't.
        <br />
        <br />
        That revelation sparked a hypothesis: what if the answer to many of our modern health struggles isn't more complexity, but less? What if we just need to get back to basics?
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm not a doctor, nutritionist, or some wellness guru. I'm an engineer who believes in data, simplicity, and the wisdom of nature. Sometimes the most revolutionary ideas are the simplest ones.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's why I created Mendel's Farm - to help people heal themselves through real food while supporting the local farmers who make it possible.
